I am currently a Postdocotarl Teaching Scholar at [Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC)](http://www.btec.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University (NCSU). My undergraduate degree is in chemical engineering and I graduated with my Ph.D. in environmental engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2012. I have worked in industry and technical consulting field for 3 years. I am passionate about the STEM education and research.

Teaching is a journey not only for students, but also for the teacher. According to ancient Chinese wisdom, teachers are those who propagate philosophy, impart knowledge and clarify doubts. Therefore, I see my duty as a teacher as not only passing on interdisciplinary knowledge and learning skills to the students, but also cultivating their motivation in seeking wisdom and appreciating beauty in both natural and social world during their lives.


### Current Interests and Projects

#### Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) projects:

* Develop new tools to enhance the learning of science and engineering concept: a multidisciplinary project, collaborating with College of Design and applying for NSF grants for Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL)
* Identify the critical factors affecting student study performances in certain discipline: a multidisciplinary project, collaborating with College of Statistics
* Design active learning activities and critical thinking scenarios for STEM education and implement them into undergraduate bioprocessing courses

#### Sustainability Research

* Analyze the sustainability of the emerging single-use bioprocessing technologies in biomanufacturing industry using life cycle assessment (LCA)

#### Water-Environment-Energy Nexus Research

* Co-culture fermentation system for enhanced H2 production from lignocelluloses
* Next-generation biofuels in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for intelligent energy management in the city
* Biofuel (ethanol) production from brewery wastewater by mixed culture fermentation

#### Industrial projects

* Data mining: environmental fate and ecological effects of chemicals (e.g. herbicides, pesticides and algal communities)
* Industrial enzyme development


### Grants
* Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) grant from Office of Faculty Development (OFD) at NCSU, 2016
* National Science Foundation grant: Reduced Extracellular Electron Shuttles (EES) as Electron Donors for H2 Production in Fermentative Bacterial Metabolism, 2008
* National Program of Science-Technology Support grant in China: Water Quality Evaluation Using Genetically Modified Microbes, 2005
