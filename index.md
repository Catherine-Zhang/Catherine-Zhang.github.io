I am currently a Postdocotarl Teaching Scholar at [Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC)](http://www.btec.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University (NCSU). My undergraduate degree is in chemical engineering and I graduated with my Ph.D. in environmental engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2012. I have worked in industry and technical consulting field for 3 years. I am passionate about the STEM education.


#### [Current Interests and Projects](http://xyzcu.github.io/projects/):
1.Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) projects:
* Develop new tools to enhance the learning of science and engineering concept: a multidisciplinary project, collaborating with College of Design and aiming to apply for NSF grants for Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL)
* Identify the critical factors affecting student study performances in certain discipline: a multidisciplinary project, collaborating with College of Statistics
* Designe active learning activities and critical thinking scenarios for STEM education and implement them into undergraduate bioprocessing courses

2.Sustainability
* Analyze the sustainability of the emerging single-use bioprocessing technologies in biomanufacturing industry using life cycle assessment (LCA)


#### Grants
* SoTL grant from Office of Faculty Development (OFD) at NCSU, 2016
